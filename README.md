# Perceptions Of Probability
This project defines an extra dimension to task estimation based on this study https://github.com/zonination/perceptions.

# Draft on Google Docs

# The Process

The estimation process, is similar to the Agile Cards, but instead of just givin one value, each developer gives 3 answers:
- In the optmist scenario, what is the complexity of this task? 3 for example
- In the pessimist scenario, what is the complexity of this task? 10 for example
- What is the likely of the optmist scenario? Answer from the likely perception list.

Based on this values - and optionaly the error margin - we can calculate the safe range of values.

# Likely Perception List:

- Almost Certainly	
- Highly Likely	
- Very Good Chance	
- Likely	
- Probable	
- Probably	
- We Believe	 
- Better Than Even	
- About Even	
- We Doubt	
- Improbable	
- Probably Not	
- Unlikely	
- Little Chance	
- Chances Are Slight
- Highly Unlikely	
- Almost No Chance
